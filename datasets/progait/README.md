# ProGait: A Multi-Purpose Video Dataset and Benchmark for Transfemoral Prosthesis Users

This is the official repository for the paper ["ProGait: A Multi-Purpose Video Dataset and Benchmark for Transfemoral Prosthesis Users"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10223) (ICCV'25).

## What is ProGait

ProGait is a multi-purpose video dataset aimed to support multiple vision tasks on prosthesis users, including Video Object Segmentation, 
2D Human Pose Estimation, and Gait Analysis. ProGait provides 412 video clips from four above-knee amputees when testing multiple 
newly-fitted prosthetic legs through walking trials, and depicts the presence, contours, poses, and gait patterns of human subjects with 
transfemoral prosthetic legs.

## Tasks

ProGait provides annotations for 3 different tasks:

#### Video Object Segmentation (VOS)
 - Bounding boxes and segmentation masks of the prothesis user

#### 2D Human Pose Estimation (HPE)
 - 23 pose keypoints of the target (17 for body and 6 for feet, following the [COCO-wholebody](https://github.com/jin-s13/COCO-WholeBody) definition)

#### Gait Analysis
 - Text descriptions of four key components:
    - The general gait category
    - The specific gait deviation
    - Recommendations on how to adjust the prosthesis to correct the gait
    - The reasons of these recommendations
